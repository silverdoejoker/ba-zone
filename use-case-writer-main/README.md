## Why this skill?

Writing a high-quality Use Case spec is harder than it looks. BAs commonly struggle with:

- **Wrong scope**: writing UCs that are too big (entire workflows) or too small (sub-functions like "Verify OTP")
- **Vague actors**: using "User" instead of specific roles like Learner, Mentor, or HR Manager
- **Embedded logic**: stuffing if/else and loops into the Normal Course
- **Missing failure modes**: only writing the happy path
- **Confusing Preconditions with Business Rules**

This skill enforces the discipline by:

1. **Scoping first** — applying Cockburn's coffee-break test, goal levels, and system boundary rules before writing anything
2. **Generating sequentially** — section by section, stopping for confirmation so issues are caught early
3. **Validating with a 20-point checklist** — every UC is reviewed before handover

---

## Features

- ✅ **English Markdown output** following the standard 16-field template
- ✅ **Sequential workflow** — 5 section groups, with confirmation gates between them
- ✅ **4 modes**: write new, split feature into UC list, refine existing, or write a specific section
- ✅ **Scoping rules** based on Alistair Cockburn (coffee-break test, goal levels, one-actor-one-goal-one-session, system boundary)
- ✅ **3 identification techniques** for breaking down large features: goal-driven, event-driven, CRUD-driven
- ✅ **20-point quality checklist** auto-run before handover
- ✅ **Bilingual output** — `output_language` variable controls the UC artifact language: `en` (English, default) or `vi` (full Vietnamese). Switch at any point in the session. Chat language is always matched to the user.
- ✅ **2 complete EdTech UC examples** included as reference (Course Enrollment, Mentor Session Approval)

## Installation

### Option 1: Claude Code CLI — User-level skill (recommended)

Install once and the skill is available across **all your projects**.

**Step 1 — Clone the repository**

```bash
# Mac / Linux
git clone https://github.com/ba-zone/ba-zone-use-case-writer.git ~/.claude/skills/ba-zone-use-case-writer

# Windows (PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/ba-zone/ba-zone-use-case-writer.git "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\ba-zone-use-case-writer"
```

**Step 2 — Verify the structure**

After cloning, the skills directory should look like this:

```
~/.claude/skills/                          # Mac/Linux
%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\             # Windows
└── ba-zone-use-case-writer/
    ├── SKILL.md                          ← main entry point (loaded by Claude Code)
    ├── references/
    │   ├── template-guide.md
    │   ├── writing-style.md
    │   ├── quality-checklist.md
    │   └── examples-edtech.md
    └── assets/
        ├── uc-template.md                ← English template
        └── uc-template-vi.md             ← Vietnamese template
```

**Step 3 — Use the skill in Claude Code**

Open Claude Code CLI (or VS Code / JetBrains extension) and type:

```
/use-case-writer
```

Or just describe what you need — Claude Code will detect and activate the skill automatically based on trigger phrases.

---

### Option 2: Claude Code CLI — Project-level skill

Install inside a specific project so only that project's Claude Code sessions load it.

```bash
# Mac / Linux — run from your project root
git clone https://github.com/ba-zone/ba-zone-use-case-writer.git .claude/skills/ba-zone-use-case-writer

# Windows (PowerShell) — run from your project root
git clone https://github.com/ba-zone/ba-zone-use-case-writer.git .claude\skills\ba-zone-use-case-writer
```

The `.claude/skills/` directory sits alongside your project's `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code picks it up automatically on next launch within that project.

---

### Option 3: Upload to a Claude Project (claude.ai web)

For users who work on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) instead of the CLI:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. In [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), go to **Projects → Create new project**
3. Upload all files (drag-and-drop the entire folder into the project knowledge base)
4. Start chatting — the skill activates automatically on relevant prompts

---

### Option 4: Use as a one-shot prompt template

Paste the contents of `SKILL.md` at the start of any Claude chat and say:
> "Follow this workflow whenever I ask you to write a use case."

---

### Skills directory paths — quick reference

| Platform | User-level (global) | Project-level |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Mac / Linux | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` (project root) |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\` | `.claude\skills\` (project root) |

> **Tip (Windows):** Open the skills folder quickly with `explorer "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"` in PowerShell.

---

## Usage

### Setting the output language

The skill uses an `output_language` session variable to control the language of the UC artifact:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `set output_language=en` · "write in English" · "UC bằng tiếng Anh" | UC document in **English** (default) |
| `set output_language=vi` · "write in Vietnamese" · "UC bằng tiếng Việt" | UC document in **Vietnamese** (toàn bộ) |

Once set, the variable applies to all subsequent UCs in the session until changed. The conversational language between you and the skill always follows your own language — the variable only affects the artifact.

### Trigger phrases

**English**:
- "Write a use case for [feature]"
- "Draft a UC for [functionality]"
- "Split this feature into a UC list"
- "Review my UC"
- "Write the Normal Course for this UC"

**Vietnamese** (skill responds in Vietnamese, UC artifact in English):
- "Viết use case cho [tính năng]"
- "Viết UC cho chức năng này"
- "Tách feature này thành UC list"
- "Review UC này giúp tôi"
- "Đặc tả use case cho [tính năng]"

### Example interaction

```
User: Viết UC cho tính năng đặt lịch mentor 1-on-1

Claude:
[Step 1] Mode: A (write new from feature description).
[Step 2] Xác nhận scope:
  Primary actor: Learner (Digital School Premium subscriber)
  Goal: Book a 1-on-1 mentor session
  System boundary: BA Zone Platform

Scope confirmed ✅. Confirm để tiến hành Step 3 (sinh UC theo từng nhóm)?

User: yes

Claude:
[Group 1: Identification + Actor + Description]

| Use Case ID: | UC-MENTOR-01 |
| Use Case Name: | Book 1-on-1 mentor session |
| ...

Group 1 done. Confirm to proceed to preconditions, postconditions, priority, frequency?

[... continues section by section ...]
```

### The 4 workflow steps

```
Step 1: CLASSIFY INPUT     →  identify which of the 4 modes the user is in
Step 2: SCOPE THE UC       →  apply 4 scoping rules + coffee-break test
Step 3: WRITE THE UC       →  fill 13 fields, ONE SECTION GROUP AT A TIME
Step 4: VALIDATE           →  run 20-point checklist before handover
```

## The 16 fields covered

> The original Karl Wiegers template defines 13 fields. This skill uses an extended 16-field version that adds **Includes**, **Assumptions**, and **Notes and Issues** — commonly adopted in IIBA BABOK practice and Cockburn's examples.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Use Case ID | Unique identifier (e.g. UC-LEARN-01) |
| Use Case Name | Action verb + Object |
| History | Created By / Date, Last Updated By / Date |
| Actor | Primary + Secondary actors (specific roles) |
| Description | 2-3 sentences: WHY + WHAT + OUTCOME |
| Preconditions | Verifiable conditions before UC starts |
| Postconditions | System state after successful completion |
| Priority | High / Medium / Low with justification |
| Frequency of Use | Quantified (X times / time unit) |
| Normal Course | Numbered, alternating Actor / System steps |
| Alternative Courses | Different paths to success (AC.1, AC.2…) |
| Exceptions | Failure modes (EX.1, EX.2…) |
| Includes | Sub-UCs called for common functionality |
| Special Requirements | Non-functional requirements |
| Assumptions | Beliefs not yet verified |
| Notes and Issues | TBDs with owner + due date |

---

## The 20-point quality checklist

Every UC is validated before handover:

| Group | Items | What it checks |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **A. Scope & Identification** | C1-C5 | Name format, goal level, ID uniqueness, single primary actor, system boundary |
| **B. Actor & Context** | C6-C8 | Specific actor role, complete description, quantified frequency |
| **C. Pre/Post Conditions** | C9-C11 | Verifiable preconditions, complete postconditions, no Pre/Assumption mix |
| **D. Normal Course** | C12-C15 | Numbered steps, Actor/System alternation, no embedded logic, complete flow |
| **E. Alternative & Exception** | C16-C18 | AC format, exception structure, common failure modes covered |
| **F. Completeness** | C19-C20 | Valid Includes, non-functional Special Requirements |

See [`references/quality-checklist.md`](references/quality-checklist.md) for full details.

## What this skill does NOT do

- ❌ **Agile User Stories** — a separate skill for User Stories + Acceptance Criteria is not included in this repo
- ❌ **Full PRD / URD / SRS documents** — UC is one section, not the whole doc
- ❌ **UML Use Case Diagrams** — this skill produces text specs, not diagrams
- ❌ **Wireframes or UI mockups** — UC describes interaction, not visual design
- ❌ **Business Process Models** — BP covers multi-actor multi-system processes; UC is 1 actor + 1 system

---

## Examples included

Two complete, validated EdTech UCs ship with the skill in [`references/examples-edtech.md`](references/examples-edtech.md):

1. **UC-LEARN-01: Enroll in a Digital School course**
   - Learner-facing UC with payment integration and async LMS fallback
   - 9-step Normal Course, 2 Alternative Courses, 4 Exceptions
   - Demonstrates: voucher payment AC, capacity race condition, async retry on LMS failure

2. **UC-MENTOR-03: Approve learner 1-on-1 mentor session request**
   - Mentor-facing admin UC with concurrency, quota enforcement, and calendar integration
   - 10-step Normal Course, 2 Alternative Courses, 4 Exceptions
   - Demonstrates: concurrency conflict, quota exhaustion at approval time, calendar service degraded-mode handling
